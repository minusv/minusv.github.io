## About Me

I’m a passionate self-taught full-stack engineer with experience in building products from scratch. I’ve built multiple products with complex features on various stacks, set up infrastructure to run them, built pipelines to deploy them, and configured tools to monitor them.

A jack of many trades, I’m not a “master” in any one language or framework but have hands-on experience in using them to solve a variety of problems. I like to take a great deal of care in the architecture and the quality of code in the things that I build.

I have experience in using Scrum Agile Methodology at my work and have conducted daily scrums and bi-weekly sprint meetings. I’ve also set up various tech processes and lead and mentored multiple teams of different sizes and skillsets.
